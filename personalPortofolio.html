    <h2 class="portfolio">Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p class="intro">Let's start this off by presenting myself.</p>
    <p class="intro">Hello! I'm an aspiring developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions and learning new technologies. This portfolio showcases some of my projects and skills.</p>
    <p id="name">My name is <em>Bogdan Mocanu</em>, I am currently <em>23 years old</em> , based in UK <em>London</em>, and I am a student at <em>Codecademy</em>.</p>
    <p class="intro">Bogdan is an <em>aspiring developer</em> currently learning <em>web development</em> through online platforms such as Codecademy.
        <br></br>
    I am currently at a <em>beginner level</em> but focused on building strong foundations in <em>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</em>.</p>
    <h2 class="portfolio">Goals</h2>
    <p class="intro">My <em>short-term goal</em> is to become proficient in <em>web development</em> and build a portfolio of projects that showcase <em>my skills and potential</em>.</p>
    <p class="intro">In the <em>long term</em>, I aspire to work as a <em>full-stack developer</em>, contributing to <em>innovative</em> projects and continuously learning <em>new technologies</em> to stay updated in the <em>ever-evolving field of web development</em>.</p>
    <h2 class="portfolio">Pain Points</h2>
    <p class="intro">One of the main challenges I face is balancing <em>learning</em> with <em>practical application</em>. While I am eager to learn new concepts, I sometimes struggle to find opportunities to apply them in real-world projects.</p>
    <p class="intro">Additionally, staying motivated and consistent in my learning journey can be difficult at times, especially when faced with complex topics or setbacks.</p>
    <h2 class="portfolio">Motivations</h2>
    <p class="intro">I am motivated by my passion for coding and creating things from scratch, especially turning ideas into something real and functional. I enjoy the creative side of development just as much as the problem-solving, and I am driven by the challenge of constantly improving my skills. <strong>A big part of my motivation also comes from my girlfriend, who consistently pushes me forward, believes in my potential, and wants to see me become the best version of myself. Her support keeps me focused, disciplined, and confident in the path I am building through coding</strong>.
    <br></br>
    <h2 class="portfolio">Learning Behaviours</h2>
    <p class="intro">I prefer a structured learning approach, utilizing online courses and tutorials to build a solid foundation. I also enjoy hands-on projects that allow me to apply what I've learned in practical scenarios and/or building stuff froms scratch.</p>
    <h2 class="portfolio">Preferred Learning Resources</h2>
    <p class="intro">I primarily use online platforms like Codecademy, VSCode, and GitHub for learning and project development. I also follow tech blogs, YouTube channels, and participate in coding communities to stay updated and gain insights from other developers. I prefer short and focused sessions over all day marathons.</p>
    <h2 class="portfolio">When Stuck</h2>
    <p class="intro">When I encounter challenges, I first try to troubleshoot the issue on my own by researching online and experimenting with different solutions. If I'm still stuck, I reach out to online communities, forums, or mentors for guidance and support.</p>
    <h2 class="portfolio">Finished Languages so far</h2>
    <p class="intro">So far, I have completed courses in <em>HTML, CSS</em>, and almost <em>JavaScript</em> too, and I am currently working on building projects to solidify my understanding of these languages. 
        <br></br>
    Going forward, I plan to continue expanding my knowledge in SQL, Data Security, and API</p>
